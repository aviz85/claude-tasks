## Entries

### 2026-01-09 01:33 #timing #habit @night
**Observation:** Extended a planned 8-min break to shower. Pattern: initial time estimates for breaks are often too short.
**Insight:** When planning night sessions, add buffer time for breaks. User is aware of body needs and will extend as necessary.

### 2026-01-09 01:20 #preference #planning
**Observation:** User needs strong framework first (what MUST/CANNOT do), then freedom to choose emotionally within that framework.
**Insight:** Always present: 1) Hard decisions (Claude), 2) Then options for emotional choice (User).

### 2026-01-09 01:05 #habit #parallel @code
**Observation:** User can work on multiple development projects in parallel (manages agents). Cannot parallel content creation (recording).
**Insight:** Stack dev tasks, sequence content tasks.

### 2026-01-09 01:03 #timing @night
**Observation:** User comfortable working late nights (1am-5am). Night = quiet time for recording content.
**Insight:** Night sessions are productive for both code (parallel) and content (quiet environment).

### 2026-01-09 01:22 #energy #preference
**Observation:** User asked about energy drops - proactively wants strategies before they happen.
**Insight:** User is self-aware about energy management. Created /boost command for this.

### 2026-01-09 03:05 #success #preference @development
**Observation:** User described the iterative building process as "feels magic" - the real-time conversation-driven development resonates deeply.
**Insight:** When marketing Agentic Apps, lead with the emotional experience of watching the system grow during conversation. This is the differentiator that excites people.

### 2026-01-09 02:42 #success #pattern @development @night
**Observation:** Spent 1+ hour shipping features (memo system, scheduled-task skill) instead of following dev schedule. User stayed engaged, didn't mention the time slip.
**Insight:** When in flow on tooling/infrastructure, user prioritizes shipping over strict schedule. Feature completion > time adherence.

### 2026-01-09 02:40 #preference #habit
**Observation:** User requested /memo with no params - wants quick trigger that "just knows" what to record.
**Insight:** User values intelligent defaults over explicit input. Design commands to guess intent when obvious.
