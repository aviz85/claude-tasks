# Energy Boost

Quick recovery when energy drops. Based on GTD energy management principles.

## Context
- Current time: [check with date command]
- Today's tasks: $tasks/today.md
- Backlog (for low-energy options): $tasks/backlog.md
- Energy patterns: Search `data/memo.md` for `#energy` `#blocker` - what helped before?

## Boost Flow

### 1. Acknowledge
"Energy drop detected. Let's get you back on track."

### 2. Quick Physical Reset (suggest)
- Stand up, stretch, 10 squats
- Cold water
- Fresh air for 2 minutes

### 3. Diagnose
Ask: "What kind of tired?"
- **Decision fatigue** → Give them the easiest task, no choices
- **Mental exhaustion** → Switch to organizing, reading, passive work
- **Physical tiredness** → Suggest 15-min power nap or real break

### 4. Offer Options

**If decision fatigue:**
Pick ONE easy task from backlog and say "Just do this, nothing else."

**If mental exhaustion:**
Offer low-energy alternatives:
- Organize files
- Review task lists
- Read/research
- Light admin work

**If still has energy but stuck:**
Try "Just Start" - suggest doing ANY task for just 5 minutes.

### 5. Context Switch Option
If working on code → suggest content/admin
If working on content → suggest code/organizing
